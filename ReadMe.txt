James Markus Project 1

To compile, type $make driver

To run, type $./driver [-h] [-t (int)sec] [(string)fileName]
	[-h]: Help
	[-t]: Enter another argument (sec) to delay log entries on average every sec seconds
		You will have to wait for the program to display the messages. Don't panic
	[fileName]: Enter a file name to write the log entries to

To clean executable and object files, type $make clean
	If you wish to, you will have to manually remove any file specified by the command line argument

As of now, I forsee no issues with running this program
